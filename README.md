# Nelisa Spaza Shop

## I am helping a spaza shop owner:

A shop owner Nelisa who is the mother to Xolani and grandmother to Ayanda lives in Khayelitsha decided to start a spaza shop soon after her brother got his bakkie because she used to work as domestic worker or unemployed. She runs her own business over the weekend, during the week Xolani helps her to do all the administration work and at the same time runs the shop.

## Nelisa wants to know what to buy in bulk: 
She to see the most popular product and catergory as well as the least popular product and category.

## She wants a web app for her spaza so that all reports be online

She wants to be able to add new products, capture sales and purchases and edit and delete them.

## Nelisa wants to limit access to her shop's data: 
Nelisa wants administrators to log in before they can use the system
Nelisa wants two different roles for authorised users - one role for people who can only see sales reports and another role for an administrator that can do everything in the system.

## Nelisa wants the navigation to be simpler: 
Nelisa wants her experience more seamless with less visible screen refreshes.
Nelisa wants to view the products list screen with a very smooth transition when searching for products by product name or category.
